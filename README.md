Hi everyone. I'm a first year EEB PhD student in the Moyle lab. I'm interested in studying the molecular mechanisms involved in pollen-style and pollen-ovule interaction and the differences between species that lead to barriers to reproduction. One thing that might not be known about me is that because I'm from Wisconsin I will always call drinking fountains bubblers. I will die on that hill. Course expectations: Greater understanding of R coding. Experience in analyzing differences in gene sequences between species. Experience with new statistical tools.
